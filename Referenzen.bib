	abstract = {In this paper we discuss Augmented Reality (AR) displays in a general sense, within the context of a Reality-Virtuality (RV) continuum, encompassing a large class of "Mixed Reality" (MR) displays, which also includes Augmented Virtuality (AV). MR displays are defined by means of seven examples of existing display concepts in which real objects and virtual objects are juxtaposed. Essential factors which distinguish different Mixed Reality display systems from each other are presented, first by means of a table in which the nature of the underlying scene, how it is viewed, and the observer's reference to it are compared, and then by means of a three dimensional taxonomic framework, comprising: Extent of World Knowledge (EWK), Reproduction Fidelity (RF) and Extent of Presence Metaphor (EPM). A principal objective of the taxonomy is to clarify terminology issues and to provide a framework for classifying research across different disciplines.},

Remote collaborators are represented on Virtual Monitors which can be freely positioned about a user in space. Users can collaboratively view and interact with virtual objects using a shared virtual whiteboard. This is possible through precise virtual image registration using fast and accurate computer vision techniques and HMD calibration. We propose a method for tracking fiducial markers and a calibration method for optical see-through HMD based on the marker tracking.},

@article{Wang2013,
	abstract = {During the last two decades, designers have been embracing building information modeling (BIM) to improve the quality of the documentation that is produced as well as constructability. While BIM has become an innate feature of the design process within the construction industry, there have been limited investigations that have examined how it can be integrated into real-time communication on-site. In addressing this gap, this paper proposes a conceptual framework that integrates BIM with augmented reality (AR) so as to enable the physical context of each construction activity or task to be visualized in real-time. To be effective, it is suggested that AR should be ubiquitous (including context awareness) and thus operate in conjunction with tracking and sensing technologies such as radio frequency identification (RFID), laser pointing, sensors and motion tracking.},

Automatically generating such representations for existing assets stirs up the interest of various industrial, academic, and governmental parties, as it is expected to have a high economic impact. The purpose of this paper is to provide a general overview of the as-built modelling process, with focus on the geometric modelling side.

@article{Behzadan2015,
	abstract = {In Civil Infrastructure System (CIS) applications, the requirement of blending synthetic and physical objects distinguishes Augmented Reality (AR) from other visualization technologies in three aspects: (1) it reinforces the connections between people and objects, and promotes engineers' appreciation about their working context; (2) it allows engineers to perform field tasks with the awareness of both the physical and synthetic environment; and (3) it offsets the significant cost of 3D Model Engineering by including the real world background. This paper reviews critical problems in AR and investigates technical approaches to address the fundamental challenges that prevent the technology from being usefully deployed in CIS applications, such as the alignment of virtual objects with the real environment continuously across time and space; blending of virtual entities with their real background faithfully to create a sustained illusion of co-existence; and the integration of these methods to a scalable and extensible computing AR framework that is openly accessible to the teaching and research community. The research findings have been evaluated in several challenging CIS applications where the potential of having a significant economic and social impact is high. Examples of validation test beds implemented include an AR visual excavator-utility collision avoidance system that enables workers to “see” buried utilities hidden under the ground surface, thus helping prevent accidental utility strikes; an AR post-disaster reconnaissance framework that enables building inspectors to rapidly evaluate and quantify structural damage sustained by buildings in seismic events such as earthquakes or blasts; and a tabletop collaborative AR visualization framework that allows multiple users to observe and interact with visual simulations of engineering processes.},

Various fields are exploiting the increasing feasibilities the concept of AR can offer; one of these being the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry. This paper introduces a research project that investigates benefits and limitations of AR for use in AEC industry. It starts with a brief background to the research before presenting a critical literature review, which forms the basis for the development and design of an AR experiment and a questionnaire for participants in the study. Results are provided with an in-depth discussion on their possible significance, before a conclusion is presented. The results suggest that although the participants believed that AR can offer a wide range of benefits to different tasks and at different stages of a project, it seems more beneficial to some specific tasks or at some specific stages than the others. Using the specific findings of this study future research in this field is proposed in different areas.},
